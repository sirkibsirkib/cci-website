On the 20th of June, Christopher Esterhuyse and Tim Mueller presented their paper (with L. Thomas van Binsbergen)
on the novel **JustAct** framework at the [2024 DisCoTec](https://www.discotec.org/2024) federated conference, held this year in Groningen.
JustAct lays a foundation for the automatic enforcement of policies that are changed by the users on the fly.

### Abstract
Inter-organisational data exchange is regulated by norms originating from sources ranging from individual consent to (inter)national laws. Verifying norm-compliance is complex because laws (e.g., GDPR) distribute responsibility and require accountability. Moreover, in some domains (e.g., healthcare), the norms themselves may be private. In contrast, standard solutions (e.g., access- and usage-control, smart contracts) reason about policies that are assumed to be public. Instead, we present a novel framework prescribing how decentralised agents decide which actions are justified, despite their partial views of the policy. Crucially, justifications are universal, e.g., accepted by future auditors. Agents establish a common notion of compliance through an (externally synchronized) agreement, which is the basis of each justification defined by policy fragments agents autonomously create, gossip, and assemble.
